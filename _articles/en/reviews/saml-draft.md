## Setting up SAML SSO for your organization (existing)

Before you start setting up SAML SSO, make sure:

* Your account has an organization. If it doesn't have an organization, go ahead and create one. Learn how to [create an organization](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/team-management/organizations/creating-org/).
* **Only the organization owner can set up SAM SSO to a Bitrise organization.**
* You have an SAML-supporting identity provider that your company uses.

1. Go to your organization's Security tab on bitrise.io.
2. Copy the Single Sign-On URL which you will use in your own Identity Provider's (IdP) site.

3. Log into your Identity Provider (IdP) and add Bitrise as an application based on the copied URL at Step 2. You will generate your Single Sign-On (SSO) credentials here.
4. Add the Single Sign-On credentials to the `Identity provider sign-on URL` and `Certificate`
   fields.
5. Click the `Configure SSO` button. All members of your organization will be automatically signed out from Bitrise.
6. Bitrise sends a notification e-mail which contains the credentials of the Organization's SSO provider. This email also shows the organization owner with his/her email address, if you needed to contact the owner for more information.
7. Members of this Organization will be prompted to sign in again by clicking the `sign In via SSO` button or using the provided URL.

You can check SAML SSO status of the organization owner and other organization members on the `People` tab of your organization. If all went well, you will see `Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled for this organization` with a `Review Users` and a `Disable SSO` buttons.

* `Review Users`: check the list of users who are registered to this SSO.
