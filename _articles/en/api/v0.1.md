## API domain/host and versioning

The Bitrise API's host is: [https://api.bitrise.io/](https://api.bitrise.io/ "https://api.bitrise.io/")

Every endpoint except the root one is versioned, and the version have to be included in the URL right after the host.

Example: [https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me](https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me "https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me") (requires authentication)

Right now we have only one version, `v0.1`.

There's no long term compatibility promise for `v0.1`, although we try to do our best to not to break anything unless we have to. Once we're happy with `v0.1` we'll "freeze" it as `v1.0`, for which we'll provide long term support.

## Authentication

The current API supports only one type of authentication: user generated **Personal Access Tokens**.

Right now **every API endpoint requires authentication**, except the "root" URL ([https://api.bitrise.io](https://api.bitrise.io "https://api.bitrise.io")).

### Acquiring a Personal Access Token

1. Sign in on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
2. Go to your **Account Settings** page
3. Select the [Security](https://www.bitrise.io/me/profile#/security) tab on the left side.
4. Click the `Generate new token` button to create a new Personal Access Token.
5. Save the generated token.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Availability of the generated token" content=" The generated token is shown only once, when it's generated! There's no way to see the token value again! You can of course generate as many Access Tokens as you like, and delete the ones you don't need anymore. "%}

### Authenticating with the API

To provide the required access token, you have to add a **HEADER** to your requests, with the key `Authorization` and value `token THE-ACCESS-TOKEN`.

An example API call with auth, using `curl`:

    curl -H 'Authorization: token THE-ACCESS-TOKEN' https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me

## Response

Every endpoint responds with a JSON formatted response.

### Pagination

When you call an endpoint that returns a list of items, you might not get the whole list in a single response. You'll have to iterate through the "pages" to retrieve all the items.

The response of such endpoints include a `paging` object, with `total_item_count` and `page_item_limit` properties. If there is a "next" page available it'll also include a `next` "anchor" item. For example, the response will show the app slug of the first app on the next page.

**Example**

    {
      "data": [ ... ],
      "paging": {
        "total_item_count": 3,
        "page_item_limit": 2,
        "next": "518e869d56f2adfd"
      }
    }

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="The `next` property of the `paging` object" content=" The `next` property of the `paging` object is only included if there's at least one more page available. If there's no `next` property inside `paging` that means that there's no more page to retrieve. "%}

The `page_item_limit` property can be set with the query parameter named `limit` at the GET requests, so you can specify the size of the response pages. The default and also maximum value for this parameter is 50.

**Example**

* Calling `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps` will retrieve you the first page of your apps with size of 50.
* If you call `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps?limit=10`, the response is also the first page of your apps, but it will contain only 10 elements.

If you want to iterate through all the items, this is what you have to do:

1. Call the endpoint without any pagination parameters
2. From the response process the `paging` object.
3. If the `paging` object includes a `next` item, call the exact same endpoint with an additional `next=` query parameter, and pass the value you got in the response as the value of the `next` parameter.

**Example**

Iterating through all your registered apps:

1. Call `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps`.
2. Process the items (`data` property)
3. Check the `paging` (root) property.
4. If there's a `next` property inside `paging`, call the endpoint again, with the `next` query parameter
   * Example: `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps?next=NEXTVALUE`, where `NEXTVALUE` is the value of the `next` property you got in your previous response.
5. Repeate this until the `paging` object does not include a `next` property, which means that the page you received was the last one.

## Endpoints

The [Bitrise API endpoint reference documentation](https://api-docs.bitrise.io) lists every available endpoint and their parameters, along with the possible responses. You can also try them out!

### Trying the API

You can try out any endpoint in the reference documentation itself! All you need to do is authenticate yourself and provide the required parameters. The API will return the appropriate response based on the call.

1. [Acquire a Personal Access Token](/api/v0.1#acquiring-a-personal-access-token).
2. Go to the [Bitrise API endpoint reference documentation](https://api-docs.bitrise.io).
3. Click `Authorize`.

4. Paste your Personal Access Token to the `Value` field

   ![](/img/available-auth.png)
5. Click on the endpoint you want to try it out to open its details.
6. Fill in the required parameters.
7. Click `Execute`.

The API will return:

* the `curl` command of your request
* the request URL
* the server response
